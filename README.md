# CREST-Research-Website

Currently, we are NOT using the "index.html" file and the "app.py".  This file was made by us originally just to test integrating a local database into the our back end of the website and showing the data on the index html file.

Currently, we are using the Templates folder, and the index2copy.html file for our current website.  We are using the WebWithMap.py python file as our "back end" for our website.  We decided to use the framework known as "flask" to be the back end language for the website.  We chose this due to the fact that we are fairly familiar with python rather than javascript.  

As of now, the "WebWithMap.py" python file is responsible for integrating our database and passing the data to our html file which allows us to display a google maps box, a clickable point, and when the clickable point is clicked, the html file has the necesarry data to call and display a small table of sensor data.

Currently, our website can only be ran locally on my laptop (Joaquin), but we are in the process of trying to make the website accessable to anyone.
